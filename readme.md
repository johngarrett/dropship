#### drop ship
From what I understand, it's just making a pretty website and selling stuff from AliExpress.

I've been getting ads for drop shipped websites and have fallen prey to them. Before buying anything, I could google the origins back to AliExpress without fault.

#### ideas
- flip image, change contrast & brightness
    - mitigate reverse image searching
    - will also give a "unique look & feel" to the images
- have some heuristic for renaming titles
- use `mytadata` to change all the exif data
    - didn't find any metadata from orignal image
